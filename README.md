# Welcome to cuecomtrade-cli! 👋

At cuecomtrade-cli, we're focused on building developer tools for the modern tech stack that are **simple to use** and **performant where it matters**.

Our journey started with experimental game engine for 2D, leading to the creation of our flagship library:

* **[logger.js](https://github.com/cuecomtrade-cli/logger.js)**: The no-nonsense, ultra-light, and lightning-fast logger.js library. ✨

Beyond logger.js, we're actively exploring and working on other critical areas:

* app.js optimization
* generator integration
* Developer experience tools
* Performance monitoring

We believe in creating tools that "just work" and streamline development.
